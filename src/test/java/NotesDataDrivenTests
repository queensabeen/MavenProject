Hooks vs Background
--Hooks:
    --are implemented for all the features across your project and they are based on annotations @Before and @After

--Background:
    --is implemented for the specific scenario
    --It is used to define a step or a series of steps which are common to all the tests inside your feature file

Data Driven Test in Cucumber can be performed in 2 ways:
    1. Scenario Outline with Examples
    2. Datatable

Scenario vs Scenario Outline:
--Scenario:
    --will run the steps only once and finish the execution

--Scenario outline:
    -- will run all the steps same number of times depending on how many sets of data you have stored inside Examples.
    -- Examples is a must for scenario outline
