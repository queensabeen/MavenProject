Imperative vs Declarative scenarios

What is acceptance criteria?
-- set of conditions and rules that a software product must meet to be accepted by the customer
-- the way we write cucumber scenarios is that they should meet the acceptance criteria


Step1:
create a feature file --> we will write the scenarios

Step2:
Create a runner class --> will be used to execute our code

Step3:
Create apiTestingFinalStep class --> implementation of test cases

Step4:
Create generateTokenSteps class --> to generate the token

Step5:
Make changes in the runners

Step6:
Write down steps in feature file

Step7:
Run the runners and copy the step implementation and paste them in the respective class

Step8:
Generate a token
Set the Base URI
    1. Given()--> headers and body
    2. When()--> POST

Step9:
Implementation of generateTokenSteps

Step10:
Implementation of apiTestingFinalSteps

Step11:
Create a class API constants and store the URI along with the base URI

Step12:
Replace the hardcode with the constants in your methods

JSON Object is a class in which we have a method
