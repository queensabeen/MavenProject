What is RestAssured?
--java library used to test APIs

Why is API testing needed?
--to validate APIs are performing the functionalities correctly

What are the main differences in API and WebServices?
-- all Webservices aer APIs but not all APIs are Webservices
-- a Webservice usually uses SOAP, REST, XML-RPC, XML-JSON whereas APIs can be exposed in multiple ways
-- Webservices always need network to operate whereas APIs do not need network to operate

What is API testing?
-- to check the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of the programming interfaces.
-- to determine if the developed API meets the expectation of functionality, reliability, performance
and security of application

What are some common protocols used to develop APIs?
--HTTP
--SOAP
--Rest
--XML-JSON
--XML-RPC
--UDDI
--JMS

What are important steps of API testing?
--Setup -> create headers, requests, authorization, body --> Given()
--Execution -> send the request to the ENDPOINT, get a response --> When()
--validate -> validate your response is as expected --> Then()

What is Request Specification?
--Object from a class in the RestAssured library
--It contains all the request specifications like our headers, authorization, body, Query parameters

What is the object response in RestAssured?
--object from a class in the RestAssured library
--it contains the response that is being sent to us by the server

What is JSONPath()?
--query language that helps us parse the json

What is Hamcrest framework?
--framework that has a library of useful matchers for matching rules

Assertions? How can we make assertions in 3 different ways?
--jUnit
--hamcrest
--RestAssured then().assertThat()

What is a resource in REST?
--treats any content as a resource which can either be text file, HTML, pages, Images or videos
--gives access to these resources and we can modify (add, delete, update, etc) these resources

How are resources identified?
--by URIs/global IDs

What are the popular ways to represent a resource in REST?
--JSON, XML, Text can be used to represent a resource, however JSON is the most popular

Which protocol is used by RESTFUL Webservice?
--HTTP

What are some key characteristics of a RESTFUL webservice?
--REST is stateless, hencer the server has no memory
--REST uses POST, GET, DELETE, UPDATE HTTP methods

What is messaging in RESTFUL webservices?
--uses HTTP to communicate to client and server
--it sends a request from client to server and gets the response, this is called messaging

What are the core components of a HTTP request?
1. URI-->Base url+Resource_url
2. Headers-->Content-type"json", Authorization
3. Body/payload

What is the difference between PUT and POST?
POST-->create a new resource
PUT-->used to update/modify

What is the format of a URI?
<protocol>://<service-name>>/<resourcetype>/<resourceID>

What is caching mechanism?
--a mechanism of storing data temporarily in a high performance memory

Explain what factors can be used to decide whether we need a REST or SOAP webservice?
--REST is preferred when performance, scalability, and ease of development is a requirement
--SOAP is preferred when enhanced level of security is the concern

What are some important status codes?
--Informational responses (100-199)
--Successful responses (200-299)
--Redirects responses (300-399)
--Client responses (400-499)
--Server responses (500-599)

What are cookies?
--collection of browsing data that is being stored
--contain assertion ID and authorization information

Are other websites able to read the cookes from some other websites?
--no, only associated with one website - only the website that created the cookie can read it

How does Stateless application get authorised when it has no server memory?
--the server returns the client a jsonwebtoken and it has a signature - known to the server
--everytime the request is made, the signature is verified
--the signature is generated by a mathematical function
--changing authorization information is going to change the signature

Is Syntax HRMS a stateless or stateful application?
--stateless

What is Oauth2.0?
--a framework that is used to develop 3rd party authentication
