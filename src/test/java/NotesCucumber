Cucumber:
--automation tool which supports BDD (behavioural driven development

--BDD is an agile software development process that creates a collab between QA, developers and any other
   non technical team members

--Uses a lang called gherkin which makes our test cases look plain in english

--Gherkin keywords:
    -Given: pre condition
    -When: action
    -Then: result/outcome
    -And: continuation of the steps above (given, when, then)

As a user, I must be able to login to HRMS application with valid given credentials

-Given navigate to HRMS login page
-When enter valid credentials
-And click on login button
-Then verify dashboard logo is displayed
-And verify username is correct

BaseClass -> starting point
PageInitializer -> initialize our objects
CommonMethods -p> common functions

In order to write a test case in Cucumber, you will need a feature file

Execute our test -- setup -- launch the browser -- navigate to url
Performing any action --

To have a feature file, you have to create a file with an extension.feature

features folder
    feature file
        scenarios
            steps:
             given
