Maven:
--Maven is a build automation tool which helps us to manage our dependencies and plugins and lets us run our
    tests properly.
--The heart of Maven is pom.xml file
--Maven has 3 basic (built-in) cycles:
    1. default - handles your project's development
        - validate: validate the project is correct and info is available
        - compile: compiles source code of the project
        - test: test the compiled source using suitable testing framework
        - package
        - verify
        - install: install the package into the local repository to use as dependency
        - deploy
    2. clean - handles your project's cleaning
    3. site - handles any project's site documentation

Functions to build:
--selectDDValue overload
--switchToFrame overload
--Actions functions - drag and drop, hover over, etc...
