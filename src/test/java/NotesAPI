If we do not have post man or any other software tool, how can we test our apis?

We know Java:
1. we need API documentation (details how the API can be used)
2. send HTTP request to the server -- using java
3. get the response from the server and using java parse that response and write test cases

we know java and want to send request to our server:
1. our server accepts HTTP request
HTTP is a protocol
    1. Write HTTP protocol in java and send our request to the server
    2.

    HTTPclient();
    Restassured();

Restassured()-->
developed to test the restful web services
Restassured follows the BDD approach
1. Given() - to prepare the request
2. When() - what type of call you are making
3. Then() - to verify

1. create an Employee;
a. URI --> BaseURI == RestAssured.baseURI = "http://3.237.189.167/syntaxapi/api";
b. Given() --> header(Authorization, Content-Type, body) -> return type -> object() -> request specification
c. When() --> call type(post(/createEmployee.php)); -> return type-> response
we have the response of our HTTP request
d.Then() --> to write our test cases
